# C-project-2---Smart-Tic-Tac-Toe
We all play Tic Tac Toe from our childhood and we know it very well. Developing this game is very easy but here I'm going to add some interesting features in it that's a little taste of AI(Artificial Intelligence).  It has options to play either with a SMART COMPUTER or EVIL COMPUTER or NORMAL PLAYING WITH FRIEND .  Normal playing with friend is common all the way, but interesting ones are smart computer and evil computer. These are smart and restricting you to become winner of the game.  1. SMART COMPUTER  smart computer is loyal and an honest player, which plays smartly that's restricting you to become a winner and seeking opportunities to become winner in the game.  2. EVIL COMPUTER  Evil computer is not an honest and loyal, it is just recalling us our cheater friend's sweet memories from our school days or our childhood. What's actually it does it's also playing smartly but if some situation comes like if you have two possibilities to become winner then it will mark two times (play's two times) in game.  Developing this application is really fun and challenging for me.  Really Enjoying Coding.
